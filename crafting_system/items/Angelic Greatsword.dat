"This incredible light forged greatsword stands out not only for it's brilliance, but for its majestic hilt as well. The handle is made out of actual seraph feathers and a gleaming halo stands out at the edge of the hilt. Claims have been made that feathers burst out in marvel when this sword vanquishes evil."
