"This manteau has been woven with a strange thread made out of bone. How bones were processed into this form remains a secret and it may be best if it remains so. The result of weaving a manteau with this horror inspiring material is a lightweight, yet sturdy piece of armor that can withstand heavy blows from even the most heroic do gooder."
