"This aegis is branded with the name Immortal for a good reason; the allow has been forged with the strongest of steel and is infused with Seyilian naqri and cerussite. It can undergo heavy fire and impact while not receiving a single scratch. This shield glimmers under the sunlight, blinding those who oppose it."
