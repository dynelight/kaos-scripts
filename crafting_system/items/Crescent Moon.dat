"This katana is forged with an other-worldly material, resembling a blend of silver with mithril. Its shaped exactly as a crescent moon, which allows it to obtain unachievable speeds and makes this a deadly weapon. It is said the moon resembled this blade the night Nallyssa committed her atrocity."
