"This citadel is a thick plate mail made out of titanium and mithril combined. Diamond dust is smelted into it as well, which makes sunlight reflection dance within its jewels. It seems this armor is a fortress upon itself, with its thick shoulder bracers resembling their towers and its torso an impenetrable stronghold. "
