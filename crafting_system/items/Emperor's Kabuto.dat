"This Kabuto is exclusive to those strong enough to lead a nation, though not necessarily worn by an emperor as whoever is most qualified is crowned with such a piece as this. Delicately crafted with metals and jewels unknown on these lands, the armor is said to have been owned by a Great Emperor from the far east."
