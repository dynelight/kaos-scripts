"Attractive in all aspects of elegant form and polish, the Shivering Cusp might look like it should be within a royal display or champion's museum rather than at the heart of a battlefield. The weapon is of exceptional craftsmanship, being lightweight, razor sharp and even having fine calligraphic runes."
