"A defensive shield of animalistic nature, the Bestial Defender is spattered with blood, fur and claw marks from the many altercations in harrowing dungeons and brooding forests. The shield has a ferocious carving of a gaping maw upon its front, complete with jutting out teeth of a very real nature."
