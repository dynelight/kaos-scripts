"Only the finest wood and purest metal went into the making of this shield. Carved from a single piece of perfect ironwood, a beautifully crafted carving of a large oak tree inlaid with silver takes up most of the shield’s face, symbolizing the carver’s offering to Hommet for the use his truly natural resources."
