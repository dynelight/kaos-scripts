"Visible from great distances and often confused with a barn or other building, the Monstrous Aegis is a sight of monumental proportions. The enormous shield is capable of bracing against even a Greater Gnollâ€™s strikes and in a pinch makes for a great umbrella for yourself and a few dozen friends."
