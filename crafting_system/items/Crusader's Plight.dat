"Born of strife and self sacrifice, the Crusaders Plight is an heirloom of Paladin lineage lines dating back to the class founding. Though made of ordinary tempered steels and silver plating, its great advantage comes from the psychological boost the wearer takes upon suiting himself with the helm, usually feeling five times the hero he likely ever truly was."
