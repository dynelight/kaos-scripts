"This wooden sickle was crafted by one of the trees Hommet hand-planted in his mortal life. The wooden sickle comes to life when striking, instantly unfurling into strangling vines causing massive damage. The wooden sickle is immediately restored to form after combat, possibly by the power of Hommet."
