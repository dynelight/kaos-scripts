"King Theagan ordered the best smiths in the land to craft the most fearsome weapon for dragon slaying. This enormous crimson lance guards the ultimate secret to vanquish wyrms: pouring dragon blood over the lance over and over again during the forging process. Dragons yield a fearsome cry when this lance pierces their defenses."
