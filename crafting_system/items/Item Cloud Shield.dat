"Protection in its fluffiest form to date, the cloud shield is completely weightless when held and soft to the touch. When struck with speed or force, the kinetic energy is absorbed by the strange cuddly shield in a rather anti-climatic defense, much to the complete disappointment of the attacker. A shield made of clouds, even your inner monologue sees the irony in this situation."
