"A shirt of chain mail reaching to about mid-thigh, this hauberk is heavier around the shoulders and chest, providing more protection to the more vital organs without being too heavy. The mail itself is sewn between two heavily padded leather shirts, giving the thief wearing it the ease of movement and whisper silence needed for their craft."
