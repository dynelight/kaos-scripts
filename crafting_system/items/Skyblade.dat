"Legends claim a man once caught lightning within his bare hands and forged this exquisitely designed blade. Upon contact, the skyblade unleashes a fearsome shock, striking even the most resistant materials. Upon closer inspection, clouds seem to be floating within the blade, perhaps a reflection of the sky itself."
