"Here before you is a helmet of valor and symbol of salvation to the Churches of Syndar. The Templarâ€™s Salvation is a holy relic from a time when religion held great power and cities were controlled by Bishops and Cardinals rather than mayors and Kings. A white gold cross is centered upon the forehead."
