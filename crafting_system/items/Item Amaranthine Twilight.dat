"Masterfully crafted from a chunk of flawless rose-colored crystal and forged to a hilt of intricately carved silver in resemblance of amaranth flowers, this beautiful dagger's edge is sharpened to perfection. It is able to pierce almost anything while the magic enhancing the crystal prevents flaws and dulling. The flowers this dagger is styled after are said to bloom only over the final resting place of Nallyssa's mortal form."
