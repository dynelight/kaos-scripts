"Going deeper within the armor shop, one enters the actual place where work is being done. An innovative canal system brings water from the sea, and allows for tempered weapons to be cooled faster. This water also gives them a particular finishing touch. A small notebook on the side notes down the instructions required to craft pieces of armor. There is an exit [3up[6 that leads back to the counter.  "
