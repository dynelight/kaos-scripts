"The Weaponsmithy of Duskan is a noisy place, where the wheeze of a bellows and the clang of hammer and anvil constantly fill the air. Racks of swords, maces, axes, etc. form aisles in the main showroom. There is a board on the side of the room with instructions on how to forge weapons. The [3south[6 door leads to the shop's counter."
