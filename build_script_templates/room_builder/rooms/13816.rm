"The stuffy shop smells of fused metals and various solvents. A wide array of half finished projects and oddly amalgamated weapons lay on shelves while some truly impressive finished products are displayed on a long granite counter before you. This is the place where all great blacksmiths and alchemists come to study the art of the magical fire and its ability to forge unheard of items of power. There is no better place to learn the skills of crafting than inside this very room. There's an exit to the [3west[6."
