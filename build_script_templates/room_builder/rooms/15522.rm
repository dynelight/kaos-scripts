"The sounds of hammers smashing steel are heard in different intensities and with lack of consistency. One quickly realizes its the drunkwards from Freelance that work this smithy, in hopes of getting a coin or two to spend either on ale or women. The air mixes the scent of steel and alcohol, as it might be poured on steel either purposely or by accident. Notes on crafting weapons are scribbled in a piece of paper that has a scent of alcohol. The smithy continues [3south[6, and exists [3north[6 to the weapons shop."
