"This sacred room is marked with runes made entirely of light. A gigantic pillar of light extends infinitely to the sky, as if it were a stairway to heaven itself. Sitting on the base of the pillar is an anvil made entirely out of light. Seraph feathers seem to fall from time to time from the pillar, and one might just land atop the steel being tempered. The exit is [3up[6."
