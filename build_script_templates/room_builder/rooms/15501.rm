" The Smithery of Terra is a noisy place, where the wheeze of a bellows and the clang of hammer and anvil constantly fill the air. Racks of swords, maces, axes, etc. form aisles in the main showroom. Instructions on how to craft weapons can be read from a sign that is located at the entrance. There is an exit to the [3north[6 that leads back to the counter. "
