"Cobblestone walls surround this open air forge. Atop a circular platform adorned in runes stands the pride of the Blood Forge. A smelter painted with the blood of the slayer guilds enemies, a large anvil forged from the bones of several humans, and animals alike can be found to the left of the Smelter construct. Several tools fashioned from humanoid femurs can be found laying on a large oak table to the right of the anvil. The room exits [3east[6."
