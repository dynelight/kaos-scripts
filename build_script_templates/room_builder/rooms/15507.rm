"Going deeper within the weapons shop, one enters the actual place where work is being done. An innovative canal system brings water from the sea, and allows for tempered weapons to be cooled faster. This water also gives them a particular finishing touch. Instructions on how to forge weapons are written down in an burned out piece of paper. The smithy continues to [3east[6 and [3up[6brings to back to the shop's counter. "
