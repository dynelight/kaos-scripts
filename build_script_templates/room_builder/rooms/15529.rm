"On the corners of this cave lie some crystal chunks that nature and time itself have shaped to serve as tools. When exposed to the dim rays of light entering this room, a blinding, overwhelming iridiscent light ignites the darkness of the room. It might be wise to use these tools within this cave, as direct sunlight (or moonlight even) could damage them and the wielder's eyes. The room exits to the [3south[6."
