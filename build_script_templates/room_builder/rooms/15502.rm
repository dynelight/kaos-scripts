"The walls of the armor shoppe are lined with a variety of armor pieces. You see everything from the crudest leather armors to new sets of plate mail. Though some of the pieces are aged and worn, you are particularly taken by the superior craftsmanship of Thegar's newer creations. Thegar left instructions on how to craft armor on a small notebook located in a table. There is an exit to the [3south[6 that leads back to the counter."
