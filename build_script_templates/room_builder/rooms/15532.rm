"The oasis, often mistaken for a mirage, stands out like a dream in the traveler's path. The crystalline water is painted with the color of the sky, and a gigantic palm covers the area from the arid sun. A wooden box of tools sits at the base of the palm tree, which can be used to make tools and weapons to survive this harsh weather. The exist back to the wastelands lies [3south[6."
