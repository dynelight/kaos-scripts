"The walls of the armor shoppe are lined with a variety of armor pieces. You see everything from the crudest leather armors to new sets of plate mail. Though some of the pieces are aged and worn, you are particularly taken by the superior craftsmanship of Melvin's newer creations. A delicate piece of paper with Melvin's handwriting describes how to forge selected pieces of armor sits on a table. The [3north[6 exit leads to the shop's counter. "
