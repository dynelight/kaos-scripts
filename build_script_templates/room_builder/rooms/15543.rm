"This room is painted in a crimson red color, which is none other less than the color of blood itself. Several gruesome tools used to process flesh and sharpen bones are available in this room. An anvil made out entirely of flesh sits on the middle of the room, and a hammer made out of bone rests atop it. Whoever created these weapons is surely an avatar from the darkest arts of necromancy...The room exits [3north[6."
