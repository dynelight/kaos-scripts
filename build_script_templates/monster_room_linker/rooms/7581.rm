"Upon entering the statuary your sight immediately becomes focused on the statue in the center of the room. All of the patterned decor here seems to draw the observer's eyes straight to it and you find it difficult to look away. Take a few steps in and have a closer look....There's an exit to the [3south[6."

 the center causing an almost hypnotizing effect. In the statuary all 
noise seems to fall away as if the statue in front of you is waiting on 
something. Is it waiting to speak or waiting on you to answer? Something

edge. There's an exit to the [3south[6."
