"Entering this shop is almost a humorous sight to all who do cross the threshold, for others who have not the sights on the walls could be seen as an act of blasphemy if not an outright declaration of war. There's an exit to the [3north[6."

"The decor of this shop is outright blasphemy to any who are not ready for it. The walls are covered in a mural phasing from one of the pagan gods to another. The murals depict Hommet, Targos, Nallyssa, Valkyzar, and Alustria all in humiliating positions almost as if making fun of them. The shop operator however tells you different that each part of the mural depicts just one of thousands of situations that these mischievous gods have gotten into and that they deserve not to be called gods but mistakes in the history of Syndar. There's an exit to the [3north[6."
