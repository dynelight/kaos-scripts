"The passage of the Initiate was originally carved out for the devout. Shortly after Hommet brought together the rock formations creating the continent Syndar this road was shaped strictly for those who would come to worship the most powerful of the divinities and all life was stricken from the area in a single breath. The passage continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."

"This path seems to have been virtually untread except for your own footfalls. When you turn your head to look back however you see no signs of even you having taken the steps you took as if the land formed back to it's proper and original template. Everything here has come to a total standstill. Not even a breeze blows through the area. A glowing violet light emanates off of everything around you illuminating your path almost inviting you as if your presence was anticipated. The road before you seems to be leading up to a sparkling and sculpted formation carved into the side of a ravine. The road behind you is black leading back into what looks like nothingness. If you go back would you just simple fail to exist...? The passage continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."
