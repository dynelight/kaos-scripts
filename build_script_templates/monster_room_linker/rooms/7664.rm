"You are stunned at the architecture this place holds on the outer parts of the room. You have never seen anything so beautiful or symmetrical. Toward the center you notice it has a more modern look to accomodate for comfort during study. The inner portions of the room are laid out with pillows and tables for the reader. There are small vestibules all around the outside of the room for people to practice some of the more arcane and antiquated magicks. Never in your life have you ever seen a larger more well equipped library. You can't wait to get your hands on any one of the thousands of books. The There's an exit to the [3north[6."

"This is the most well kept room you have ever seen. The books themselves look as if they have not aged a day but are in fact are some of the oldest books in Syndar. The Library is full of books, tomes, scrolls, scratchings, encyclopediae, and a hundred million other forms of sharing knowledge. Anyone of them predates the entire population of Syndar and shares truth as to the history behind it. Many thousands would kill to destroy this place because the knowledge alone shared here could be the ruination of Hommet, Nallyssa, Valkyzar, Targos, and Alustria. This does not even account for the powerful spells, incantations, recipies, and all-around wizardy at the hands of any and all who are allowed to enter this place. Any one of them in the wrong hands could build a civilization or destroy a continent....The There's an exit to the [3north[6."
