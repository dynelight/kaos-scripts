"You are in the street of the City of Kaos. The cobblestones that make up this road, on closer inspection, are actually jewels of every kind. [1Rubies[6, [2Diamonds[6, and [3Emeralds[6 make up the streets of this hidden underground place of worship. The jewels are covered in ancient protection runes spoken by Kaos himself. Is that what you think it is to the [3north[6? A shady little shop is to the [3south[6. Kaos Street continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."

"The City of Kaos is a secret underground collective of followers who are given the opportunity to worship Kaos without persecution and hindrances of the misguided believers of the other five pagan gods. Here they may perform rites and rituals in reverent worship of their chosen god. It is protected on high from invaders by runes of protection from Kaos himself and is literally built on untold riches. You notice there are no guards in sight. Is that what you think it is to the [3north[6? A shady little shop is to the [3south[6. Kaos Street continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."
