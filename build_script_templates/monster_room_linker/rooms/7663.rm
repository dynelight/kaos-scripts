"The Tavern of Kaos is nearly empty as most of the followers are deeply devoted and have found other things to keep them occupied besides the drink. An old man sits in the corner hand tightly wrapped around his ale. His long white beard almost reaches the floor and he sits in a shaded area. The Tavern smells as new as the day it was formed. You may exit the Tavern of Kaos to the [3south[6."

"Though it be empty the Tavern of Kaos is often packed come the evenings. Smells of roasted boar, fragrant and heady wines, and freshly baked bread often draw the devoted worshippers from their daytime rituals to celebrate and gather in the name of Kaos. For now the tavern is barren except for one silent very old man in the corner who seems to be coddling his ale. You notice he seems to be repeating the same thing silently to himself over and over that you think sounds like an incantation of some sort. You may exit the Kaos of the Tavern to the [3south[6."
