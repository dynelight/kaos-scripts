"You have entered the Kaos Utility Shoppe. The room is pretty much empty as very few people have ever been here and even less have attained the item that is the reason for this shop being here. If you are in here then it is likely that you are the right combination of stalwart, courageous, agile, and cunning. There's an exit to the [3west[6."

"You are standing in the Kaos Utility Shoppe. There isn't much here but a single female elf behind the counter. She is attending to her business while you look around. The shop is pretty much empty except just for the counter, a glass case behind it and above that a sign that says Nosce te ipsum, Nosce Kaos. There's an exit to the [3west[6."
