"This is the final stretch on your way to the Blessed Temple of Kaos. The path of illumination becomes brighter still as you near its end. It glows brighter with each passing step feeling your anxiety and responding accordingly until you reach its end. Looking down you see the same inscription carved into the earth below your feet as if to serve as a reminder for those who tread this path. The path continues to the [3east[6 and [3west[6."

"The inscription reads......Long is the way and hard is the path. Only the most devout may enter here for you shall serve my purpose. Let no creature enter here who will not come to realize I am the nature of reality and all will come to bow before me. In reverence shall you stand kneel before me and in service so you shall be. Good and Evil are an illusion presented to you by the inferior powers who are not worth to contemplate my existence, there is only power and choice and mine is the only choice. It is only when I diminish my influence that life and order is allowed to exist. For now I choose to remain dormant but upon my awakening you will come to know my power for a fleeting moment before I send you back into the fray of the ether. I am Kaos there is no other power greater. The path continues to the [3east[6 and [3west[6."
