"All around you are stone pillars that look like they were grown not carved from the earth below it. Beyond them is magnanimous stone gate that no living creature could open on sheer strength alone but here it is, slightly cracked open beckoning you to enter. Standing in front of the Kaos Temple's Outer Gates looking over to the massive structure in the distance makes you feel uneasy. Your mind runs rampant with a hundred thousand thoughts a second wondering what your next step should be making you think twice about entering these unsympathetic doors but something inside you wills you on. There's an exit to the [3east[6.You may continue towards the temple through the gates to the [3west[6."
