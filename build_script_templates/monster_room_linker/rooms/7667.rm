"You have entered the Temple of Kaos. The final end to a journey that it takes many quite a long time to make. From a birth into deception to truth the pilgrimage encompasses not only distance but time as well. The Temple, oddly enough, you come to find out is larger on the inside than it shows on the outside encompassing a great number of worshippers. Many who are worshipping here do so in complete silence. You will find no loud raucous song or dance here in celebration of pagan festivals or self-glorification of the divine. Here you will only find silent chanting, contemplation, and traditional rites being performed by the clergy who guard this place against all outside evils. The light in the center of the room piques your curiosity since this entire place is underground and is not a false light from a fire. You may exit the temple to the [3south[6."

"The Temple of Kaos is purely decorated by his worshippers to show the respect, love an admiration they truly feel for their Lord. The temple is covered in beautiful draperies, art, sculptures, fragrances, and architecture from top to bottom but the floor is a cold solid stone. The priests are adamant that no one who worships here may touch any of the beautiful things because they are all meant in homage toward Kaos and are therefore sacred gifts to their Lord. There is a light that drops down from the ceiling onto a single artifact in the center of the room. You cannot make out what the artifact is nor can you see where the light emmanates from but as far as you can tell it comes from nowhere and it is too bright to be a false light from a fire which is quite odd altogether since this entire city is underground. The priests claim it is the countenance of Kaos shining down in protection of this holy relic but you are less than sure about that yourself. You may exit the temple to the [3south[6."
