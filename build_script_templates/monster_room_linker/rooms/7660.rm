"You have found the Gate of the City of Kaos. Though underground it stands tall before you at an overwhelming height making you stand back just to get a full view. The gates are covered in an unrecognizable and almost ancient rune of protection to stave off any and all who might come to disturb this holy place. You notice there are no guards in sight. You may enter the city to the [3east[6 or go back up to the Kaos Temple First Floor by going [3up[6."

"You stand before the Gate of the City of Kaos. The City of Kaos is a secret underground collective of followers who are given the opportunity to worship Kaos without persecution and hindrances of the misguided believers of the other five pagan gods. Here they may perform rites and rituals in reverent worship of their chosen god. You notice there are no guards in sight. You may enter the city to the [3east[6."
