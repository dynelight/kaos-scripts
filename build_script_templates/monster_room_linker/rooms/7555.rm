"You stand before the Hallowed Gates of the Temple of Kaos. Very few have heard of this place beyond whispered rumors and even fewer have seen it. But now standing before it you understand just how grand it is and even more why no one has been here before now. A disturbing chill begins to run up your spine something about this place just isn't right. You may enter the Temple of Kaos through the gates to the [3west[6 or you may run to safety to the [3east[6."

"The Kaos Temple is formed into the side of a ravine that sits in the cavern wall. As with most of the architecture in this area it looks to have been grown and not carved or built. None of it seems to have any detachable parts or has been fused from any part of it. The spires stand tall and proud as if there for the purpose of self-glorification. The flags at the top of each spire flap as if in a breeze though there is no wind. The entire temple is illumined in a blue throbbing glow and wraps around a central steeple that stands independently and simultaneously as part of a deep seated central stone column standing at the center of the entire chamber as a backbone to it and the temple. You may enter the Temple of Kaos through the gates to the [3west[6 or you may run to safety to the [3east[6."
