"Shoppe of the Kaosian Armorsmith"
""
"You enter the armor shoppe and almost faint at the sight. The armors in this shop look like they are crafted by the hands of a god. They shine with a green glow lighting up the entire shop. The shop itself is humble and small. There is a simple man in the back heating up some steel in a fire so hot that Targos himself would be burned. It seems odd but you think you may recognize the man as if you have seen him somewhere before. There's an exit to the [3north[6."

"The armors hang from the walls and light up the shoppe in a green glow. The simple man in the back smiles at you while heating up his next divine creation. As you wander around the shoppe you are impressed that such a simply equipped place could even produce such majestical wonders. It is incredible feat that such a humble place could give a birth to such remarkable creations. The entire room is covered in ancient runes that you recognize were on the seals of a few scrolls from Kaotic Academia de Veritas. There's an exit to the [3north[6."
