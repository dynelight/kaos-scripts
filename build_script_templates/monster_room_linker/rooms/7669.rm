"The City of Kaos is a secret underground collective of followers who are given the opportunity to worship Kaos without persecution and hindrances of the misguided believers of the other five pagan gods. Here they may perform rites and rituals in reverent worship of their chosen god. It is protected on high from invaders by runes of protection from Kaos himself and is literally built on untold riches. You notice there are no guards in sight.  Kaos Street continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."
