"Sparkling a dim purple the walls around you are wide with no end to how high they go. The path ahead is lit up by the same ethereal glow that lit the path before you and now lights the path ahead of you. The road continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."

"Echoing louder now without the wind to carry it a loud unearthly shrieking can be heard seemingly originating in every direction thanks to the acoustics, but for a more discerning ear it seems to carry from ahead in the distance of this monstrous subterranean chamber. With walls as high as the eye can see you cannot tell where the canyon edges meet and instead of a sky or a ceiling all you can see is darkness above you. The path below you is still illuminated and entices you forward. The road continues to the [3west[6 and [3east[6."
