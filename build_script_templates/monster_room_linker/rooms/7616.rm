"The corridors of the temple stands opposite to it's very idea. How odd that it should be everything that chaos is not. Everything looks the same and it is difficult to navigate without getting confused. You come to a dead end the corridor continues back to the [3east[6."

"Where chaos is disorganized and tumultuous these halls are clean and constructed in such a manner to convey a cold unfeeling architect's attempt at ironic humor. Every corner looks the same every pattern repeating as if it was designed by someone obesessed with order. The twists and turns leading in multiple directions causing confusion as to which way you need to go. Getting lost in here isn't a possibility, it's a promise. You come to a dead end the corridor continues back to the [3east[6."
