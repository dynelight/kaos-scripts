"The corridors of the temple stands opposite to it's very idea. How odd that it should be everything that chaos is not. Everything looks the same and it is difficult to navigate without getting confused except you notice three statue's, one to the [3north[6, one to the [3south[6, and the last one to the [3east[6."

"This room almost looks similar to the others but something about it looks somewhat different. You can't quite figure out why but there is something here that is out of place. It is as obsessively ordered as every other room in this place except there is part of it that looks slightly askew...if only you could put your finger on it and find the truth beneath the lie....
