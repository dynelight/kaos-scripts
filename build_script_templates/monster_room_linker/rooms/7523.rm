"Leaving the gate behind you find the road disappears and you are quickly surrounded by hard earth and mineral formations. The path ahead is lit up by the same ethereal glow that lit the path before you and now lights the path ahead of you. The path continues to the [3west[6. You may go back towards the gate to the [3east[6."

"The lifeless vegetation on the road gives way to a canyon of glowing minerals and rock which and comes to a close over your head leaving you in a large cavernous underworld. With walls as high as the eye can see you cannot tell where the canyon edges meet and instead of a sky or a ceiling all you can see is darkness above you. The path below you is still illuminated and entices you forward. The path continues to the [3west[6. You may go back towards the gate to the [3east[6."
